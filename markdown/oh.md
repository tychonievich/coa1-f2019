title: Office Hours
...

Professor offices hours are in the professor's office.
If I'm engaged with a student, don't just wait silently in the hall; ask me if you can come in and join the other student(s) there (often the answer will be yes, and even if no I'll know you are waiting).

TA office hours are in Thornton Stacks (A-235), and are requested by using the [office hour queue](https://archimedes.cs.virginia.edu/coa1-f2018/oh.php).
The queue is open even when TAs are not present; see [contact information](policies.html#contact) for when to expect TAs in office hours.
