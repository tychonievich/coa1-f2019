# Addressing modes

Operands of most operations may be either a register, an immediate value, or the contents of memory.
A memory address in general is made of an immediate, two registers, and a scale on one of the registers:
`imm + rA + rB*s` where `s` is one of the four specific values `1`, `2`, `4`, or `8`.

# Two syntaxes

For mostly historical reasons, x86-64 has two different syntaxes.

Feature         Intel syntax        AT\&T syntax                Mnemonic 
-----------     ------------------- --------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
Register        `rsp`               `%rsp`                      AT\&T has a \& in its name, and wants similar symbols elsewhere
Immediate       `23`                `$23`                       AT\&T has a \& in its name, and wants similar symbols elsewhere
Reg+Imm Addr    `[rsp+23]`          `23(%rsp)`                  **In**tel uses **in**fix operators
R+R*4+Imm Addr  `[rsp+r8*4+23]`     `23(%rsp,%r8,4)`            **In**tel uses **in**fix operators
`a += b`        `add rax,rbx`       `addq %rbx, %rax`           **Int**el starts with what that answer goes **int**o; **A**T&T starts with the **a**rgument.

In general, AT&T syntax is more explicit: there are prefixes for types,
operations have width suffixes, etc.
Intel syntax, on the other hand, is more loose, 
and has to add things like `QWORD PTR` if the instructions operands do not make the width of a command obvious.

----------------------------------- -----------------------------
`mov QWORD PTR [rdx+0x227],rax`     `mov %rax,0x227(%rdx)`

The width specifiers are

bits    historical name                                         Intel name  AT&T Suffix register names     
------- ------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----------- ----------------------
8       byte                                                    BYTE        b           ah, al, r9b, ...

64      quad word                                               QWORD       q           rax, r9, ...

The most popular \*nix toolchains default to AT&T syntax.
The most popular Windows toolchains default to Intel syntax.

# Registers

The general-purpose program registers in x86-64 have somewhat ideosyncratic names:

8-bit   16-bit  32-bit  64-bit  calling  callee-save  notes
------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------------- ----------------------------
al, ah  ax      eax     rax     return                special meaning for multiply and divide instructions
cl, ch  cx      ecx     rcx     arg 4                 
dl, dh  dx      edx     rdx     arg 3                 special meaning for multiply and divide instructions
bl, bh  bx      ebx     rbx                           
spl     sp      esp     rsp             yes           stack pointer
bpl     bp      ebp     rbp             yes           
sil     si      esi     rsi     arg 2         
dil     di      edi     rdi     arg 1         
r8b     r8w     r8d     r8      arg 5         
r9b     r9w     r9d     r9      arg 6         
r10b    r10w    r10d    r10                   
r11b    r11w    r11d    r11                   
r12b    r12w    r12d    r12             yes   
r13b    r13w    r13d    r13             yes   
r14b    r14w    r14d    r14             yes   
r15b    r15w    r15d    r15             yes   

The registers overlap in the low-order bits.
Thus, if r15 is `0x0123456789abcedf` then 
r15d is `0x89abcdef`,
r15w is `0xcdef`,
and r15b is `0xef`.
Some registers also have names for both the lowest-byte `_l` and next-higher-byte `_h`.
Thus, if rax is `0x0123456789abcedf` then 
eax is `0x89abcdef`,
ax is `0xcdef`,
al is `0xef`,
and ah is `0xcd`.

In part because x86-64 has preserved backwards compatibility with many previous architectures
all the way back to the 16-bit integer-only 8086,
many newer operations have been placed in their own register bank with their own operations.
As one of the larger examples, floating-point operations are not handled from the main registers.
However, we'll restrict ourselves to the registers above and the operations that work on them.

# The most important instructions

x86-64 has thousands of instructions, but many of them are used only in fairly specialized cases.
The following instructions are the most important to understand x86-64 code.

## Move

The various `mov` instructions implement, in effect, the assignment operator `=`.
Moves can be done between registers, memory, and immediates, with some limitations;
as a rule of thumb, either the source or destination must be a register.

When moving from a smaller source to a larger destination, `mov` has two variants:
`movzx` (**z**ero-e**x**tend) fills in the extra high-order bits with zeros,
and `movsx` (**s**ign-e**x**tend) fills in the extra high-order bits with copies of the high-order bit of the source.

There is a special "swap" instruction `xchg`, though it is usually used to implement a no-op not a move.

There are special moves for moving between register banks (as, e.g., moves to and from the XMM registers, etc).

There are also *conditional* moves which only moves if the condition codes indicate the last compared value had a particular relationship to 0, although those are fairly uncommon in compiled code.

## Jumps

Jumps move the `pc` to a new location.
`jmp` does this unconditionally,
and various other instructions do so conditionally.
Conditions in x86-64 are based on the "condition codes", a set of single-bit flags
that store enough information to compare a value to 0.
Condition codes are set by most ALU operations, as well as by the special `cmp` and `test` operations.

Because comparisons are done differently for signed and unsigned values,
there are multiple versions of comparions:

`je`, `jne`
:   Jump if the compared values were equal (`je`) or not equal (`jne`)
    or the result of the last operations was equal to 0 (`je`) or not (`jne`)

`ja`, `jae`, `jb`, `jbe`
:   Jump if the first compared values was **a**bove/**b**elow the other, using unsigned comparisons.

`jg`, `jge`, `jl`, `jle`
:   Jump if the first compared values was **g**reater/**l**esser that the other, using signed comparisons.

There are also conditional jumps that check just single bits of the conditions codes, one of moderate commonness being `js` which checks the sign bit.
    
## Load Effective Address

One specific instruction, `lea`, is widely used.
It looks like a memory-to-register move, but instead of loading the contents of memory at an address
it loads the address itself.

Because addresses are computed by adding two registers and an immediate, with one address being multiplied by a small power-of-two constant, `lea` is commonly used to perform basic arithmetic.
For example, code like `a = 5*b + 20` can be written in AT&T syntax x86-64 as `lea 20(rbx,rbx,4),%rax`.

## ALU operations

Most ALU operations are implemented in x86-64 as assignment operators in code.

Instruction     Is like
--------------  ---------------
`add`           `+=`
`sub`           `-=`
`and`           `&=`
`or`            `|=`
`xor`           `^=`
`shl`           `<<=`
`shr`           `>>=`, zero-extending
`sar`           `>>=`, sign-extending

These instructions also set the condition codes.
Additionally, `cmp` sets the condition codes like `sub`, and `test` like `and`, but both without storing the result in a register.

Multiplication and division are implemented differently.
The result of addition can be one bit larger than its largest operand,
which makes `+=` a relatively safe way to handle it;
but multiplication can result in twice as many bits as the largest operand,
and the circuitry that does division also does modulus as the same time,
meaning both effectively have multiple registers of return value(s).
There are several variants, but to get a feel two are described below:

`imul X`
:   multiplies rax by register *X*, storing the 128-bit result
    with the high-order 64-bits in rdx and the low-order in rax.

`idiv X`
:   divides a 128-bit numerator (high-order bits in rdx, low-order in rax)
    by register *X*, storing the quotient in rax and the remainder in rdx.


## Push and pop

The behavior of `push X` can be described as

    rsp -= 8
    memory[rsp] = X

The behavior of `pop X` can be described as

    X = memory[rsp]
    rsp += 8

Note that some programs use only 32-bit and smaller values,
and use a variant of `push` and `pop` that adjust `esp` by 4 instead of `rsp` by 8.

Push and pop are widely used in common function call protocols,
for argument passing and register saving,
as explained in [Calling Conventions].

## Call and return

`call X` means "push the address of the next instruction, then `jmp X`.
`ret` means `pop PC` -- an instruction not otherwise writeable using `pop`
because `PC` is not a program register.

## No operation

Compilers generate a surprising number of operations that do nothing.
Called "no-ops" or "nops," these are used to align certain instructions with multiple-of-8 addresses
and other less-than-obvious optimizations.

Some no-ops may the specific no-op instruction `nop`,
and others are encoded as meaningless instructions like `xchg %eax,%eax`


# Calling Conventions

Although not intrinsically dictated by the ISA itself,
it is common for ISAs to be accompanied by a recommended calling convention.
This involves three primary components:

Argument passing
:   Invoking a function (with `call`) involves jumping to its code and storing where to return to.
    That code needs to know where to find it's arguments.
    
    x86-64's most common calling convention^[Unlike other platforms, Microsoft toolchains use just 4 registers for arguments: rdx, rcx, r8, and r9] puts the arguments, in order, in 
    rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, and r9.
    Remaining arguments, if any, are pushed onto the stack, last to first, before the `call`.

Return value passing
:   The code that invokes a function needs to know from where to retrieve it's return value.
    x86-64's most common calling conventions put the return value into rax.

Callee- and caller-save registers
:   In general, both the code that invokes a function and the code of the function itself
    will use all the program registers.
    This means that the old values of these registers must be saved and restored.
    
    x86-64 calling conventions distinguish between callee-save and caller-save registers.
    
    A caller-save register is one that the invoking code must assume the invoked code might have changed,
    thus necessitating saving it before the call if it contains meaningful data to the invoking code.
    It is also one that the invoked code can use without first saving and later restoring.
    
    A callee-save register is one that the invoking code can assume the invoked code will not change,
    and thus the invoking code does not need to save before the call.
    It is also one that the invoked code cannot use unless it first saves its value
    and restores that saved value to the register before returning.
    
    The most common way to save a register is to push its contents onto the stack using `push` (as, e.g., `push %rax`)
    or a similar `rsp`-based `mov` (as, e.g., `mov %rax,-32(rsp)`).
    
    x86-64's most common calling convention^[Unlike other platforms, Microsoft toolchains use rbx, rbp, rdi, rsi, rsp, r12, r13, r14, and r15 as callee-save and rax, rcx, rdx, r8, r9, r10 and r11 as caller-save] identifies
    rsp, rbp, and r12 through r15
    as callee-save registers and
    all others (rax, rbx, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, and r8 through r11)
    as caller-save.

Note that all of the above is merely convention.
A program could violate all of these rules and still work fine,
but it might have some difficulty interacting with other functions if it does.
In that way it is similar to conventions about what side of the street to drive on
or what color of traffic signal light means "stop":
the decision is fairly arbitrary, but if you make a different arbitrary decision than others do
then things are not likely to go well for you.


# The most common x86-64 instructions

For the curious, I counted how many times different instructions occurred
in the 200,723,121 instructions comprising the programs in the `/usr/bin` directory of my installation of Manjaro Linux.
The following table lists the most frequent, omitting those that use different register sets.
