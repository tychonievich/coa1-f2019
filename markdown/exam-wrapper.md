title: Exam Wrappers
...

Exam Wrappers are a tool to help you reflect on and learn from your exam experience^[See [the teaching commons](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/teaching-talk/exam-wrappers) for a decent introduction to the idea of an exam wrapper.] and earn back some lost points.

To submit yours, see the deadline on the schedule or submission site.
Your should prepare a plain-text file (i.e., the kind you create with `vi`, `nano`, etc)
named `exam`*number*`wrapper.txt`
containing containing the following sections:

1. Preparation

    Reflect on how you prepared for the exam and how effective that was.
    Don't limit yourself to the days immediately before the exam; how effective were you approaches to learning the material as the semester progressed as well?

2. Errors
    
    List each mistake you made on the exam, and explain the correct answer.
    If possible, also explain why you answered incorrectly: what confused you?
    
    If there are questions you got right, but based on the wrong reasoning, explain those too.

3. Plans
    
    Wrap-up this exam experience by planning what you'll do differently in the future.

Optionally, you may add a fourth section

4. Feedback
    
    What did you think of the exam itself? Are there topics you prepared for that we didn't ask about? Are there questions you felt were unfair or ambiguous? Is there something we could have done to have made this a better exam?

We'd appreciate you separate your sections with headers underlined in equals signs and adding blank lines between paragraphs.

An example template might be:

If you do not submit a wrapper, your initial exam score will stand as your exam performance. If you do submit  a wrapper, that score can only go up, not down.
