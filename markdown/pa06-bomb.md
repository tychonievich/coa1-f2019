title: Bomb PA
...

# Work alone

**Do not** share solutions or your bomb or part thereof with students or any other non-course-staff person.

You may discuss *strategies* and *code patterns*, but not specifics.

# Task and Grading

You'll use the same bomb you did for [the lab](lab06-bomb.html). If you worked with someone else in lab, you can download your own bomb using the same bomb download site.

Credit will be awarded as follows:

Grade       Criteria
---------   ---------------
80%         2 phases defused
95%         3 phases defused
98%         4 phases defused
99%         5 phases defused
100%        6 phases defused
+1%         each additional phase defused

If you have more than 20 explosions, we will remove points.

There is no submission needed besides running the bomb and typing the correct inputs, which will update [the scoreboard](http://kytos.cs.virginia.edu:12506/scoreboard) which will be used to populate the gradebook after the PA closes.
