title: Bomb PA
...

# Work alone

**Do not** share solutions or your bomb or part thereof with students or any other non-course-staff person.

You may discuss *strategies* and *code patterns*, but not specifics.

# Task and Grading

You'll use the same bomb you did for [the lab](lab06-bomb.html). If you worked with someone else in lab, you can download your own bomb using the same bomb download site.

Credit will be awarded as follows:

Grade       Criteria
---------   ---------------
80%         2 phases defused
95%         3 phases defused
98%         4 phases defused
+1%         each additional phase defused<br/>(including extra credit if you get more than 6 phases)

If you have more than 20 explosions, we will remove points.

There is no submission needed besides running the bomb and typing the correct inputs, which will update [the scoreboard](http://kytos.cs.virginia.edu:12506/scoreboard)^[If you downloaded from the backup site, use  the backup server: <http://hazel.cs.virginia.edu:12506/>] which will be used to populate the gradebook after the PA closes.
